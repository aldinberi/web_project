This is a project made using MERN stack with the goal of learning the stack.

This system will provide the user ability to see where it is the cheapest to buy a desired product among several vendors. User will be able to enter the desired product and get the cheapest price for it and which vendor is selling it.

In the system we have two types of accounts: users and vendors.

Entities: Users, Products, Vendors, Coupons and logs.

Notable features: JWT token for authorization, pagination on requests, database level request validation,
the usage of React of Redux to minimalize the network requests needed to be made.
